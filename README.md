PROMPT

You are doing work for a client that wishes to invest in a property in Amsterdam. They plan to turn the property into an AirBnB hotel. Before they decide to invest, they would like clear data about the AirBnB performance in that specific market, such as: what property types receive the most positive reviews, which neighbourhoods host the most listings, how much revenue successful hosts generate, and so forth. From this data, your client will be able to make a more informed decision about whether to invest and which neighborhood to invest in. You have been provided with scraped data captured by a web program that pulled information from the AirBnB website; this data may contain unformatted data points with duplicate entries. You will want to clean and format the data prior to performing exploratory analysis, which will help you better understand the available data and build some business context. You will be presenting your progress to your clientâ€™s consultants. They will want to hear the cleaning techniques you used and the metrics/insights you were able to identify. Keep in mind, they wish to understand the local market and its potential to host a profitable AirBnB hotel - demand is key, as is the price point.
